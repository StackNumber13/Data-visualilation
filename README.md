Homework: Image Processor Application
Introduction

This homework assignment involves developing a simple image processing application using Python. The application allows users to upload images, apply various filters, and adjust parameters like brightness, contrast, and sharpness, then save the processed images. We use the tkinter library for the user interface and Pillow for image processing.
